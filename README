#NICE TO HAVES

1) Fully implement the rest of the word-press API so word-press clients will work with shout mouth - look at variations and support

3) Re-factor the lookup for authentication using the strategy pattern


#To Get A Demo Up And Running - Runs the site on test data made up from the tests (bundler must be installed)

- browse to the localhost:9393

						
#Tested Blogging Clients
