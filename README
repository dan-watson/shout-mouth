TODO:
--------------------------
1a) Slugs need to be unique
3) Split out tags and categories into own tables rather than hanging them as arrays of of the pos class (kind of was a good idea for
speed in the beginning but now we are sorting and filtering posts by them it sucks!!!) 

#NICE TO HAVES
1) Fully implement the rest of the word-press API so word-press clients will work with shout mouth - look at variations and support
	-update rsd generation to inform blogging clients that other api's are available
	
2) Enable the ability to write plugins for the sidebar - and social bookmarks
3) Re-factor the lookup for authentication using the strategy pattern


#To Get A Demo Up And Running - Runs the site on test data made up from the tests (bundler must be installed)
- bundle install (I would recommend using RVM to manage your gemsets)
- rake specs:run_all 
- shotgun --env=test
- browse to the localhost:9393

						
#Tested Blogging Clients
- Windows Live Writer (fully supported)
- Wordpress Client For Ipad - (ropey at best - need to implement all wp methods)
- Blogger Client For Ipad - (ropey at best - this is due to the clients interpretation of how the api should work - should work after wp methods implemented)
