TODO:
--------------------------
1) See how RC does his code snippets - when importing current blog replace markup.
2) Wire back to front
5) Editing a post - need to add a legacy_url if the page title changes
6) Refactor API methods - encapsulate xmlrpc call to object with strategy pattern due to the variation
						   in the xml parameter ordering
						- look at callbacks for the authentication - would be nice to just call :before(:all, authenticate) DRY
						- encapsulate update and delete logic inside the model classes.
						
						
7) Add take task not in the public repo that will pull data from current blog and transform markup and also the
   image url + upload.
