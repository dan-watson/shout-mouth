2) Enable the ability to write plugins for the sidebar - and social bookmarks
3) Re-factor the lookup for authentication using the strategy pattern


#To Get A Demo Up And Running - Runs the site on test data made up from the tests (bundler must be installed)
- bundle install (I would recommend using RVM to manage your gemsets)

- browse to the localhost:9393

						
#Tested Blogging Clients
