1) See how RC does his code snippets - when importing current blog replace markup.
2) Wire back to front
5) Editing a post - need to add a legacy_url if the page title changes
6) Refactor API methods - encapsulate xmlrpc call to object with strategy pattern due to the variation
						   in the xml parameter ordering
						- encapsulate update and delete logic inside the model classes.
						- add default scopes for pages and posts with ordering and active
						
7) Add take task not in the public repo that will pull data from current blog and transform markup and also the
