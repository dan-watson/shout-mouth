TODO:
--------------------------
1a) Slugs need to be unique
2) Create an S3 importer file onto of the current metaweblog import
3) Split out tags and categories into own tables rather than hanging them as arrays of of the pos class (kind of was a good idea for
speed in the beginning but now we are sorting and filtering posts by them it sucks!!!) 

#NICE TO HAVES
1) Fully implement the rest of the word-press API so word-press clients will work with shout mouth - look at variations and support
	-update rsd generation to inform blogging clients that other api's are available
	
2) Enable the ability to write plugins for the sidebar - and social bookmarks
3) Re-factor the lookup for authentication using the strategy pattern


#To Get A Demo Up And Running - Runs the site on test data made up from the tests (bundler must be installed)
- bundle install (I would recommend using RVM to manage your gemsets)
- rake specs:run_all 
- shotgun --env=test
- browse to the localhost:9393

						
#Tested Blogging Clients
- Windows Live Writer (fully supported)
- Wordpress Client For Ipad - (ropey at best - need to implement all wp methods)
- Blogger Client For Ipad - (ropey at best - this is due to the clients interpretation of how the api should work - should work after wp methods implemented)
