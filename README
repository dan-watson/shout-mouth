TODO:
--------------------------
2) Clean up left to right code in the main shout_mouth class	
3a) Slugs need to be unique
4) Add take task not in the public repo that will pull data from current blog and transform markup and also the
   image url + upload.


#NICE TO HAVES

1) Fully implement the rest of the word-press API so word-press clients will work with shout mouth - look at variations and support
	-update rsd generation to inform blogging clients that other api's are available
	
2) Enable the ability to write plugins for the sidebar - and social bookmarks
3) Re-factor the lookup for authentication using the strategy pattern


#To Get A Demo Up And Running - Runs the site on test data made up from the tests (bundler must be installed)
- bundle install (I would recommend using RVM to manage your gemsets)
- rake specs:run_all 
- shotgun --env=test
- browse to the localhost:9393

						
#Tested Blogging Clients
- Windows Live Writer (fully supported)
- Wordpress Client For Ipad - (ropey at best - need to implement all wp methods)
- Blogger Client For Ipad - (ropey at best - this is due to the clients interpretation of how the api should work - should work after wp methods implemented)
