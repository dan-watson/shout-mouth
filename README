TODO:
--------------------------
1a) Slugs need to be unique
2) MAKE SURE ONLY ACTIVE POSTS ARE PULLED BACK FROM TAGS AND CATS
3) DATA-MAPPER IS SUCKING A BIT - LOTS OF SELECT N+1 ISSUES - TRY TO RECTIFY - STOP LAZY LOADING CHILDREN ALL THE TIME

#NICE TO HAVES
1) Fully implement the rest of the word-press API so word-press clients will work with shout mouth - look at variations and support
	-update rsd generation to inform blogging clients that other api's are available
	
2) Enable the ability to write plugins for the sidebar - and social bookmarks
3) Re-factor the lookup for authentication using the strategy pattern
4) Hierarchal Pages - then supported by the word-press API
5) Data driven menu for pages
