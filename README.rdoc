===Known Issues
- Error relating to permissions on the db folder and shout_mouth.db file (Cannot connect to readonly database) - change permissions on the file and folder to rectify this. rake:sqlite_file_permissions 

- Error writing to the public/cache directory - you need to fix permissions so that the webservers process can read/write from/to the folder.

===Writing Plugins For Shout Mouth

1) Create a directory structure inside the app/plugins folder as shown below.
- Convention matters	

	-app
	----plugins
	-----------easy_rider
	---------------easy_rider_plugin.rb
	-----------view
	-------------easy_rider_plugin.haml
	
2) The information below is based on writing a new plugin called "easy rider"

- our easy_rider plugin should contain a class file named easy_rider_plugin.rb whose class name should be EasyRiderPlugin
- our easy_rider_plugin.rb file needs to reside in a folder called easy_rider under the plugins directory (see above)
- EasyRiderPlugin class should inherit the base class Plugin (see below)
- EasyRiderPlugin class should implement one method from the base class which is data (see below)
		
		class EasyRiderPlugin < Plugin
			def data
				Post.all_active #or any other data from the model api
			end
		end
		
		
- All classes that inherit from Plugin have access to all of shout mouths model classes and data
- our EasyRiderPlugin classes data method can return any object and will be passed down to the view
- a HAML layout file should be included in the view folder called easy_rider_plugin.haml. The view folder should reside under the easy rider directory
- by convention the variable name containing the returned data inside the view will be called easy_rider
	
		-easy_rider.each do |easy_rider|
			%li
				%a{:href => "/bikes/#{easy_rider.bike}", :rel => "follow"}=easy_rider.bike
				
				
3) To place a plugin on one of your pages just call the following code (example is for easy rider).
- please note you may need to restart your application for your plugin to register

		= plugin(PluginFactory.instance.get_plugin(:easy_rider))
