===Code Syntax Highlighting For Posts
Automated syntax highlighting will occur for any techincal posts by wrapping your code inside a pre tag with the prettyprint class.
  <pre class="prettyprint"> 
  class Blog
    include Shout::Record
        
    storage_names[:default] = "settings"

    property :key_name, String, :length => 200
    property :value, String, :length => 200
    property :type, String, :length => 50
    
    validates_presence_of :key_name, :value, :type
    
  end
  </pre> 

===Writing Plugins For Shout Mouth

1) Create a directory structure inside the app/plugins folder as shown below.
- Convention matters	
    -app
    ----plugins
    -----------easy_rider
    ---------------easy_rider_plugin.rb
    -----------view
    -------------easy_rider_plugin.haml

2) The information below is based on writing a new plugin called "easy rider"

- our easy_rider plugin should contain a class file named easy_rider_plugin.rb whose class name should be EasyRiderPlugin
- our easy_rider_plugin.rb file needs to reside in a folder called easy_rider under the plugins directory (see above)
- EasyRiderPlugin class should inherit the base class Plugin (see below)
- EasyRiderPlugin class should implement one method from the base class which is data (see below)

    class EasyRiderPlugin < Plugin
      def data
        Post.all_active #or any other data from the model api
      end
    end

- All classes that inherit from Plugin have access to all of shout mouths model classes and data
- our EasyRiderPlugin classes data method can return any object and will be passed down to the view
- a HAML layout file should be included in the view folder called easy_rider_plugin.haml. The view folder should reside under the easy rider directory
- by convention the variable name containing the returned data inside the view will be called easy_rider
- you can also add global settings by calling Blog.your_setting = "your value" which can be retrieved using Blog.your_setting

    -easy_rider.each do |easy_rider|
      %li
        %a{:href => "/bikes/#{easy_rider.bike}", :rel => "follow"}=easy_rider.bike

3) To place a plugin on one of your pages just call the following code (example is for easy rider).
- please note you may need to restart your application for your plugin to register
    = plugin(PluginFactory.instance.get_plugin(:easy_rider))
