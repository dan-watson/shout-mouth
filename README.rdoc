===ToDo

- Fully implement the rest of the word-press API so word-press clients will work with shout mouth - look at variations and support.
- Update RSD generation to inform blogging clients that other api's are available
- Hierarchal Pages - then supported by the word-press API


===Demo Information

To Get A Demo Up And Running - Runs the site on test data made up from the tests (bundler must be installed)

	bundle install (I would recommend using RVM to manage your gemsets - ruby 1.9.2) 
	rake db:demo_data
	shotgun --env=test
	browse to the http://localhost:9393
	connect your blogging client to http://localhost:9393/xmlrpc or http://localhost:9393/xmlrpc.php (default wordpress) 
	with username: dan@shout_mouth.com password: password123


===RAKE TASKS
	rake db:create  (Create The Database)
	
	rake db:delete  (Delete Database)
	
	rake db:demo_data  (Seed Demo Data)
	
	rake db:update    (Upgrade The Database To The Latest Schema Version)
	
	rake import:posts url=http://yourblog.com user=username password=password posts=number_of_posts current_user_email=email from_blog_engine={{your_engine}}
	Currently only supports blogengine.net for from_blog_engine - this is just used to set legacy redirects
	Before running this rake task you should run rake users:create and then set the current_user_email parameter to the freshly created users email 


	rake import:remove_height_and_width_from_images (Remove image tags height and width attributes from all posts - I have found that some blog clients add height and width attributes to image tags)
    

	rake import:repoint_images upload=1 
	(Updates all images path to Amazon S3 account - if upload is set to 0 then s3 upload will not occur but all image tags stored in each post will be repointed to your amazon s3 account - rake task uses the amazon s3 settings inside config/config.yaml)

	rake specs:run_all - (Run All The Specs)

	rake users:create  create email=email password=password firstname=firstname lastname=lastname (Create a user)  


===Tests
To run all the tests
	rake specs:run_all

===Tested Blogging Clients
- Windows Live Writer (fully supported)
- Wordpress Client For Ipad - (ropey at best - need to implement all wp methods)
- Blogger Client For Ipad - (ropey at best - this is due to the clients interpretation of how the api should work - should work after wp methods implemented)


===Writing Plugins For Shout Mouth

1) Create a directory structure inside the app/plugins folder as shown below (CONVENTION MATTERS)
	
	-app
	----plugins
	-----------easy_rider
	---------------easy_rider_plugin.rb
	-----------view
	-------------easy_rider_plugin.haml
	
2) NAMING MATERS - information below is based on writing a new plugin called "easy rider"

- easy_rider plugin should contain a class file named easy_rider_plugin.rb whose class name should be EasyRiderPlugin
- easy_rider_plugin.rb file needs to reside in a folder called easy_rider under the plugins directory
- EasyRiderPlugin class should inherit from Plugin (class EasyRiderPlugin < Plugin)
- EasyRiderPlugin class should implement one method only from the base class which is data
		
		class EasyRiderPlugin < Plugin
			def data
				Post.all_active #or any other data from the model api
			end
		end
		
		
- All classes that inherit from Plugin have access to all of the applications model classes and data
- EasyRiderPlugin classes data methods can return any object and will be passed down to the view
- A HAML layout file should be included in the view folder called easy_rider_plugin.haml. The view folder should reside under the easy rider directory
- By convention the variable name containing the returned data inside the view will be called easy_rider
	
		-easy_rider.each do |easy_rider|
			%li
				%a{:href => "/bikes/#{easy_rider.bike}", :rel => "follow"}=easy_rider.bike
